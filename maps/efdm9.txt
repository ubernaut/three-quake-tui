The scenario: you're doing routine maintenence work on the lower level 
of this facility when you say to your mates, "bugger this work shit, 
let's have a deathmatch intead". Your eloquent proposal is greeted with 
great enthusiasm, and the motion is thus unanimously passed.

Designed for 1on1 (with either dm1 or dm3 rules), FFA 3-6 (defenitely
use dm3 rules here), you might even want to try 2on2... it could work.

I was inspired in part by id's 'The Slimy Place' (q2dm something), I 
really dig the orange pipes/bright green slime combination. I believe
the layout and architecture are my own though (well, with the exception
of the pipes of course :)

I thought up the name 'Tangerine Dream', because I wanted to suggest
something orange of course, and because it sounds cool. Apparently it's
the name of some band (I found this out from a quick search of the web)
but I have never heard their music... probably some dodgy 70's stuff.
In any case, I must have heard of them somewhere, and I recalled the 
phrase when I was doing the word-association thing with 'Tangerine'. :)

Fun things to do in efdm9 include standing under the RA and lobbing
grenades down the pipe to the MH area (you get a bonus frag sometimes :)
and picking people out of the air in the outdoor area... as they 
respawn and jump down for the RL. Overall efdm9 is not as intense and
hectic as efdm8, which is a bit of a shame imho... but it's a little
different, and hopefully you'll dig it anyway. If you enjoy it, please
send me an email to let me know (I still haven't played it, d'oh).

Tangerine Dream also probably makes for a very pretty slideshow if you
have a p133 or under. If you're getting less than 30 fps, I apologise,
and I want you to know that I feel your pain, brother.
