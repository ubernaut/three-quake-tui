This map  was made  under the strong unfluence of textures. This 
level  exist only thanks to  John Fitzgibbons'  "Rubicon" single 
player map.  [zed] made for duels  primarily, but  also suitable 
for 4ffa. If you'll decide to play with  more players...methinks 
that it will be pure massacre.


I made this map in the two versions:

   First  - common map                            -   zed.bsp
   Second - with built in OmicronBot support 	  - zed_o.bsp       *
	
* - Second version you can download from my page only [see above]
